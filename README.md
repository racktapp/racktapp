# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions or are running into issues with deploying the app, you can find help in a couple of ways:

*   **Visit the Support Page:** The app has a built-in [Support Page](/legal/support) with helpful information.
*   **Contact Us Directly:** For any issues, please feel free to email the support team at [racktapp@gmail.com](mailto:racktapp@gmail.com).

## Testing GDPR consent

1. Run `npm run sync` to build and sync native platforms.
2. Launch the Android app in an EEA emulator.
3. Verify analytics and ads stay disabled until you accept the UMP form.
4. Change your decision later via **Settings â†’ Privacy & Consent**.
